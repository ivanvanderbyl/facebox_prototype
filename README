Facebox for Prototype
based on Facebox by Chris Wanstrath -- http://famspam.com/facebox

Originally ported to Prototype by Phil Burrows - http://blog.philburrows.com

This version will include animation and templates for Rails, released as a plugin or gem somewhere down the track.

Usage:
Copy facebox.js into public/javascripts/
Copy images to public/images/

This Prototype version is setup to automatically run when the window's load event is fired (see last three lines of this file),
so usage is as easy as adding rel="facebox" to any link you want to use Facebox.
