h2. Facebox for Prototype

Based on Facebox by "Chris Wanstrath":http://famspam.com/facebox

h3. Why another modal window? 

Because we needed one which worked with Rails and Prototype.

Its super simple to use:
# Just copy the following files to their respective places<br>
 	images/facebook<br>
 	javascripts/facebook.js<br>
 	stylesheets/facebook.css<br>

# Include the facebook.css into your template
# Include the facebook.js into your template
# Any links you want to load in a Facebox, just add the rel="facebox" attribute.

h4. Features (Coming soon)

* Rails helpers
*	Ability to load images and existing content into window
*	Better event handling
