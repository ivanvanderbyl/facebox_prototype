h2. Facebox for Prototype

Based on Facebox by Chris Wanstrath -- http://famspam.com/facebox

h3. Why another modal window? 

Because we needed one which worked with Rails and Prototype.

Its super simple to use:
# Just copy the following files to their respective places
 	images/facebook
 	javascripts/facebook.js
 	stylesheets/facebook.css

# Include the facebook.css into you template
# Include the facebook.js into your template
